# ResolutionAnalysisMATLABCode
The repository contains the MATLAB scripts needed to do the resolution analysis described in the paper by Falk &amp; Hansen 2023.
To run the analysis make sure all the files are in the same directory and run the function MainCode.m within MATLAB.
Parameters for inversion can be set in the function Primary.m
